                    <p>As part requirement of my masters degree, I had to develop a physical device that solves a tangible problem in the society. At the time,
                    I was just learning how to ride a bike and I was alarmed at the fact that bicycles didn't come with sensors that alerts you to other vehicles around - especially behind you.</p>

                      <h3>Constraints</h3>
                      <p>The biggest constraints to this project was time and money. Money influenced the kind of technical components purchased for this prototype.
                      </p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="margin-below">
                      <h3>Process</h3>
                      <p>To design this application, I went through a series of steps to get the job done:</p>
                      <div class="margin-below">
                        <p><b>1. Research</b> After I had the insight to explore this problem, I conducted research in 3 layers:
                        </p>
                        <span class="margin-bottom"> <b> a) Academic research </b>- To see if this problem solves a tangible problem, which is one of my main objectives. Research showed that more than 26,000 people died yealy from bicycle accidents in Europe (European Road Safety Road Observatory, 2018). A key number
                        that was caused by unawareness of oncoming vehicles.</span> <br>

                        <span class="margin-bottom"><b> b) Market research</b> - To discover how this problem was currently being solved and not to replicate an exististing solution, I conducted a market research. This research revealed different existing solutions in the market. A popular one which is the bike mirror.
                        This solution however isn't popular among millennials since they perceive it as rather odd</span> <br>

                        <span class="margin-bottom"> <b>c) User research - Interviews</b> - To understand how my target users would feel about a solution that could potentially help with navigating bike lanes as a cyclist, I asked 5 users between age 22 - 35 about
                        what they thought of 'bike mirrors' and if they currently used it. None of my participants had ever used it. When asked 'why', 2 of them objected to the idea, calling it 'old fashioned'. 3 just hadn't thought of it and would not consider using it in the future either.
                      When asked if this bike mirror solved a tangible problem, they all agreed. But the problem - it just wasn't cool enough.</span>

                      </div>

                      <div class="margin-below">
                        <p> <b>2. Insights from Interviews: </b>
                          After all my interviews - Academic, market and user research - I highlighted my key insights: </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Bicycles need a solution that alerted them to oncoming vehicles within 3 meters radius (according to research - this is the closest a vehicle should be before it becomes dangerous)</li>
                        <li>The solution should be discreet, since millennials wouldn't want something obvious</li>

                        </ul>
                      </div>

                      <div class="margin-below">
                        <p><b> 3. Technical Research:</b>  With the insight I have, I did a research of how I could potentially solve this problem technically.
                        What the technical constraints were and what hardware I could use given the money constraint.</p>

                        <p><b> 4. Ideating:</b> With the technical constraints in mind, I sketched potential ways of how the problem could be solved and how the solution could fit on a bike while still being <b>discreet</b> and <b>simple</b>

                          <p>Based on feedback collected after the first testing, I changed a few key things to solve the persisting problems:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Reduce the size of the container.</li>
                            <li>Introduce wiring that extended the placement of sensor to behind the bicycle to improve sensor readings</li>
                            <li>Introduced LED light to help with feedback relay - <i class="text-danger">red</i> for danger and <i class="text-success">green</i> for safe </li>
                            <li>Made the lid translucent to make the LED feedback strong</li>
                            <li>Introduced a latch using to fix device to the bicycle</li>

                          <p>I tested with 5 of my target users, on open streets and designated bicycle lanes to
                          find how using the product worked for them and also their perception of the product. The following is the summation of insights gained during testing: </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Participants loved the concept - the idea that they can listen to music while cycling with the aid of this device was especially thrilling for participants.</li>
                            <li>Bicycles nowadays are designed with different kinds of handlebars. Placement of <i>bike assistant </i> is dependent on the type of handlebars the bicycle has.
</li>
                            <li>More and more bicycles now have special devices attached to their handlebars, to include a bike assistant, the solution has to be designed to be smaller (i.e more discreet to fit in an already congested handlebars)</li>

                      <h3>Outcomes and Lessons</h3>
                      <p>Although building the prototype of this solution was a success and resulted in a successful grade, continuous implementation
                      has been suspended due to time and funding constraint. However this project gave me a huge insight into the scope of industrial design/ergonomics.</p>
                      <p>Were I to continue this project in the future, I would like to solve the following existing problems:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Make the device even smaller that it becomes completely miniscule</li>
                        <li>Use a stronger sensor that picks up 360 deg readings</li>
                        <li>Use wifi or blootooth tech so as to do away with wiring</li>
                      </ul>
