          <p class="h4 font-weight-bold">Summary</p>
          <p class="pb-3"> The PMC is a vital department in Siegwerk. They are the department that provides audit and quality control checks for Siegwerk customers. They analyze data gathered from customers and offer them improvement solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="h4 font-weight-bold">Role</p>
          <p class="pb-3"> UX consultant and designer</p>
          <p class="h4 font-weight-bold">The Challenge</p>
          <p>I was asked to consult with the PMC department to provide options on how to digitalise their processes. As it stands, the workflow is primarily done offline, data gathered with paper & pen, and stored across all MS documents and analysis done with excel sheets. The challenge here is to bring digitalise their workflow while also ensuring accurate data collection, analysis and storage. To get this done, it involved the efforts of the PMC department, the data science team and I.

              <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-center">Process</h3>
              <p class="text-center">To design this solution, I went through a series of steps to get the job done:</p>
              
              <ol type="I">
                <li> <span class="font-weight-bold pb-3">Disovery:</span> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>This involves reading all the available documentation the PMC could share with me.
                      </li>
                    <li>Having sessions with multiple PMC staff to understand their workflows and needs
                      </li>
                    <li>Multiple workshops with the PMC chief and other members of the department to clarify documentations, processes, and uncertainties
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                  <li><span class="font-weight-bold pb-3">Analysis: </span>Creating use case scenarios to understand all the possible scenarios involved and what a systemâ€™s expected reaction could be. </li>
                  <li> <span class="font-weight-bold pb-3">Sketching & Clarifications:</span> Sketching possible solutions and confirming with some members of the PMC  department. All members of sub departments were represented.

                  </li>
                  <li><span class="font-weight-bold pb-3">Hi-fi design and testing: </span> Creating a hifi design and prototype and testing the whole workflows with the PMC & development team making sure solutions still align

                  </li>
                  <li> <span class="font-weight-bold pb-3">Iteration:</span> eBased on feedback gotten from workshop, designs were continuously reiterated on until we got a buy in from all 5 sub departments.

                <h3 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Outcome</h3>
              <p> The following results were achieved due to the previously mentioned process: </p>
              <ul class="mb-4">
                <li>Due to the fact that there were no central documentation, there was also no standard process across the 5 sub departments in PMC. Through our workshops, we were able to help the department define a standard process
 
                  </li>
                  <li>Using this standard processes, we decided to first start with a digitalisation of their database and project creation process.</li>
                  <li>These two efforts are the first focus of the PMC digitalisation efforts and the development team is currently helping to bring it to life.
