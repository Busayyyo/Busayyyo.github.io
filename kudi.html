              <span> <i>Kudi</i> was the first user experience job I ever had. I was offered the role because of my background in Psychology and creative writing.</span><br>
              <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Goal of the Project:</span>The challenge was to design a bot for financial service. A bot that was user friendly and also efficient.</span><br>

                  <ol>
                    <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Target Audience:</span> <span>People between ages 16 - 45 who were day to day bank users and tech savvy.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Method:</span> <span>Interviews & Contextual Inquiry. </span></li>
                    <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Medium:</span> <span>Primarily Whatsapp - I gathered data through whatsapp since ideal users are supposed to be conversant with chatapps.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Inquiry:</span> <span>Two tier of questions such as the following were asked:</span></li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>a) - <em class="has-text-weight-bold">how people relate to the idea of financial chatbot</em> With questions such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>How often do you go to banks?</li>
                    <li>Would you prefer to do your banking transactions through chats if you could?</li>
                    <li>If you wouldn't, why? What are your concerns?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>b) - <em class="has-text-weight-bold">How people talk to bankers in real life</em> with questions such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>what do you say when you want a withdrawal?</li>
                    <li>How do you express to the cashier that you need to make a transfer?</li>

              <div class="mt">
                <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold"> 2. Scenarios</h3>
                <p> Based on the data gathered, I came up with a full scale scenario in which a typical user would use the chat app based on the goals they set to achieve. Hence, there were multiple scenarios -</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Onboarding scenario</li>
                  <li>Money transfer scenario</li>
                  <li>Bill payment scenariod</li>
                  <li>Surfing through/Getting to know bot scenario</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="mt">
                <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold"> 3. Deciding the bot's persona</h3>
                <p>Based on data gathered from users, we already knew what they disliked about bankers and banking halls and what they would love to see more. Together with the stakeholders, we decided the bot would be:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Friendly</li>
                  <li>Feel Human - but not too human!</li>
                  <li>Smart - but only about things relating to finance</li>
                  <li>Efficient</li>
                  <li>Trustworthy</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="mt">
                <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold"> 4. Designing the bot's persona </h3>
                <p>With the goal of having a friendly and effient bot in mind, the following tactics were used to achieve these goals.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>friendly - semi-formal tone and voice and use of emojis whenever appropriate.</li>
                  <li>Make it feel human - There were many ways this was achieved. Examples include:</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Using the 'Kudi is typing' feature that slows replies for a milisecond to not appear too programmed.</li>
                    <li>Admits in a cheeky state that it's a bot when compounded with existential questions</li>
                    <li>Answers all questions the user might have concerning it's transactions and if it does not have one, it should refer/redirect the user to a 'human'</li>
                    <li>Efficient - using short, simple and unambigous words and sentences to communicate</li>
                    <li>trustworthy - give immediate feedback and answers questions about security!</li>
                  </ol>
                </ul>

              <div class="mt">
                <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold"> 5. Task Flows</h3>
                <p>What comes first and what comes next? The <b>scenario</b> helped in making this part easy. I mapped out typical conversations a user would have with the bot into flows such as </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Greetings</li>
                  <li>Make a request</li>
                  <li>Bot Response</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Up to the point where they achieved their goals, while also creating alternate routes a user could take</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold mt">6. Writing the bot replies</h3>
                <p>With all the above in mind, writing the replies become easy.
                  The general guideline of simple, clear and conscice was employed.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold mt"> 4. Testing</h3>
                <p>Two main types of testings were conducted at different intervals of designing and post deployment of the bot.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A/B testing to choose between different variants of a reply</li>
                  <li>Usability testing - to see how people actually respond to the bot and its words. Also to see if they were achieve their goal effectively and efficiently.
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
                  <h3 class="subtitle has-text-link has-text-weight-bold mt"> 5. Final Outcome</h3>
